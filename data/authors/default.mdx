An aspiring DevOps or Platform Engineer specializing in Go Language and eliminating toil through automation.

"Doing systems properly is as much about people as about machines", I value camaraderie. Through the DevOps culture, I was exceptionally drawn to the idea of connecting people and linking up ideas.

Adaptable and resourceful, I'm always eager to learn new technologies and discover new ways to streamline menial operational tasks. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic problem solver; I strive to be proactively reactive towards incidents and find immense fulfillment in engineering an efficient pipeline for others.

Off the screen, I enjoy reading on new perspectives and mountain-biking.
