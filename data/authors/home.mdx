An aspiring Platform or **Site Reliability Engineer** specializing in Go Language and eliminating toil through automation.

_"Doing systems properly is as much about people as about machines."_

I value camaraderie. Through the DevOps culture, I was exceptionally drawn to the idea of connecting people and linking up ideas.

Off the screen, I enjoy reading on new perspectives and playing volleyball.
