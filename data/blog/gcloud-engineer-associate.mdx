I'm thrilled to have been certified by Google Cloud as a Certified Cloud Engineer - Associate on GCP! Here's why you should be a multi-cloud user:

People may ask why I'd pick up another cloud platform beyond what is required for my job, but I would not want my current cloud platform to be my one-trick pony. Besides, cloud engineering is fun anywhere!

- Exploring the myriad platform and software as a service that each cloud provider offers to their customers, and being up-to-date with the latest trends!
- Developing a higher tolerance for different setups, and keep yourself learning. You will never know what kind of environment you will be asked to manage and operate tomorrow.
- Exposing yourself to multiple authentication and authorization controls, different data stores and compute offerings will help you gain critical thinking skills and understand your own preferences.
- Becoming a better cloud architect in the long run, enabling you to choose the right services from the right cloud provider while understanding the tradeoffs in the future

To distinguish the intricacies and differences between multiple clouds is key to being a successful cloud engineer. Especially as a consumer of cloud services, you want to keep operational costs and technical debt low and maintainable.

Google Cloud has been a wonderful journey in seeing innovative approaches to developer experiences and has very strong opinions on how a platform should be set up, I genuinely appreciate that value.

I'm more than excited to continue my GCP journey and the ever-learning opportunity in the cloud. What SaaS service interests you the most right now in the cloud?
